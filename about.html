    I've always loved to create since I was young. I had a huge imagination for
    solving problems by constructing a solution. I also loved technology and was
    incredibly interested in computers. In middle school, I got introduced to
    computer science. It was both of my passions, creative problem solving and
    computers, combined into one. My computer science career took me to
    Quinnipiac University where I am getting my BS in Computer Science and a
    minor in Mathematics. I expect to graduate in May 2024. If you would like to
    see more about projects I've worked on over the years, check out the
    Projects page.

      Outside of computer science, I love cooking and mixology. I find it
      amazing that there are so many different dishes and drinks that can be
      made with the same set of ingredients.

      Something that is very important to me is physical activity. In many jobs
      and especially in computer science it's easy to stay indoors and not get
      much excercise. To balance this, I workout often and take advantage when
      the weather is nice to get outdoors. My favorite time to be outside is on
      a sunny lake day. Whether its relaxing on the dock or waterskiing behind
      the boat, it's always a great time.

      Here's a picture of my dogs Oliver and Nora. They are toodles which is a
      mix of a poodle and a tibetan terrier.
