        Junkademy is my senior capstone project. It is a web application that
        allows the user to arrange high level code blocks into a vertical
        format. The arranged list of code blocks is then translated into
        syntactically correct Java code and is presented to the user. The goal
        of this app is to provide a tool for people to practice and learn coding
        concepts without having to learn complicated syntax. This project is not
        yet finished and is currently in development.

      <p>
        Thirst Mate was an android application designed to help people shop for
        all of their mixology needs. The user could choose a drink and set a
        desired quantity of how many they want to make of that drink. The app
        would then create a shopping list of the required ingredients and
        amounts based on the quantity. If there was a drink they wanted that was
        not in the app, the user could add any custom drink they want.
